# NOTES APP

## The Rust Notes App is a simple application that allows you to create notes via your CLI

<p>The project will get anyone conversant with the basics of Rust such as datatypes, converting types, variables, io, functions, mutability, lists manipulation etc I also ensured to add substantial comments to allow anyone to understand the code.</p>
<p>There are better methods to handle a lot of processes here but I kept it as simple as possible to avoid using a lot of imported modules</p>
